"""
These are the policy decorators as POST conditions for the API calls.
I.e. these conditions are executed after the wrapped API call.
This module uses the policy base functions from
privacyidea.lib.policy but also components from flask like g.

Wrapping the functions in a decorator class enables easy modular testing.

The functions of this module are tested in tests/test_api_lib_policy.py
